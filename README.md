## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned more about the use of the position property in CSS. I also learned how to use the z-index property to control the stacking order of elements. I also learned how to use the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to create the shapes in the design.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/position/) - This helped me understand the position property in CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the z-index property in CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/a/after-and-before/) - This helped me understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements in CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
